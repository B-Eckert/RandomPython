# RandomPython
This is as the repository says. It's a repository for all the little miniature python projects I want to do.
### Some Projects
- A font converter that takes text and converts it into unicode characters from dicts also converted from text files
- A fun 'game of life' type thing where I was trying to make a genetic algorithm that showed the evolution of creatures with limited food
- A different fun game of life thing where I was also trying to make genetic algorithms but didn't take food and stuff into account
- Random generators based on millisecond time for D&D usually
- Heads/Tails coin flipper
- Something that formats JSON into plaintext and takes all of the fields called name
- An enter remover/adder that replaces all indents and multiple spaces with blanks and you can specify = where you actually want indents
- Multithreading projects including a coffee survival script
- Experimental genetic algorithms
- And more!
Feel free to explore the repository at your leisure.
